# Prepare environment

1. Install Jupyter

```bash
pip3 install jupyter
```

On VSCODE, go to extension and search for Jupyter, then install it.

```bash
# create the folder for the project
> mkdir churn_model
> cd churn_model

# create a virtual environment inside the project folder
> python -m venv my_virtual_env
> cd my_virtual_env
> ls
# activate the virtual environment (in the cmd)
> venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Now, you can follow along in the [notebook](./script.ipynb)
